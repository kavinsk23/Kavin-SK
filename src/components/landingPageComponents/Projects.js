Atoms include basic UI elements like buttons and input fields, while Molecules combine these to form more complex components such as form fields and card elements. Organisms are larger, reusable sections like navigation bars or product cards. Templates define page layouts using these components. The Storybook setup enhances collaboration with UI/UX designers, making it easier to maintain and scale the front-end codebase. "
